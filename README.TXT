To Build
--------

        $ cc -o prog prog.c


Usage Examples
--------------

	$ ./prog file1 file2

	$ ./prog -d file1 file2

	$ sh ./prog-test.sh | more


Features
--------

* "An O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm" by Wu, Manber, Myers, Miller.

* Output compatible with patch(1).

* Strokes one of the judge's ego (I couldn't email chocolate or curry).


Description
-----------

This is a functioning micro diff tool using an [O(NP) algorithm][Wu+89],
compared to the older [O(ND) difference algorithm][Mye86] used by some
versions of diff.  Its output is based on the default diff(1) output
described by POSIX and [The Open Group Base Specifications][SUSV7].  The
output is suitable for use with patch(1).

The -d option simply writes the edit distance between file1 and file2.
